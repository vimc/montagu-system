    <ul>
        <li>Only you will log in using your email address and password. You won't share your password with others. (If
            someone else in your group needs to be able to log in just let us know!)
        </li>
        <li>Any data that you download from Montagu which is not publicly available elsewhere will be subject to the
            Consortium publication policy. The use of this platform should serve the purposes of data sharing and
            analysis generation within the context of this project.
        </li>
        <li>Montagu can store your name and email address. We (Imperial College London) will only use your information
            to allow you to access this software for the duration of the Consortium (2017-2022) and/or as long as you
            are a member. We will never share your information outside the Consortium without your consent.
        </li>
        <li>Montagu can log how and when you use Montagu, including your IP address. We will never share this
            information outside of the core delivery team, and it will only be used for security audits and to plan how
            to improve Montagu. (For example, if there is a feature that nobody is using, that might tell us something
            is wrong with it!)
        </li>
        <li>If you want us to remove your information, you will not be able to access this software as it is only
            available to registered users.
        </li>
    </ul>
